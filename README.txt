Cardibo 1.0

The source code to our wireless sensor network for gym monitoring using Arduino microcontrollers and Nike+ shoe sensors.  

The code will get progressively cleaner and better commented as time goes onâ€¦for now it's just a dump from our server with sensitive items removed.

The Nike+ shoe pod is a relatively cheap, affordable wireless impulse detector.  While it is possible to decrypt the 27 Byte message that the shoe pod is sending when it detects an impulse, doing so requires decompiling proprietary source code for decryption (research this issue more thoroughly if you intend to try this, as you could very well tread on Apple/Nike IP that shouldn't be tread on).  As such, the utility of the sensor without the Nike/Apple watch or iPod hookup is limited to a simple ON/OFF sensor, e.g. if a transmission from the Nike+ is received, then do something.

More to come in the future.
