	We've got a lot of fun and exciting things going on here at Cardibo, all to make your gym-going experience more enjoyable.  We're constantly working to improve the site, and we wanted to give you a taste of things to come.<br /><br />
	<span class = "question">WHEN TO GO</span><br />
	It's 6pm and you can't decide whether you should hit the gym now or after dinner.  Enter our prediction system.  We collect an extensive amount of data regarding the status of machines in the gym.  We can use that data to predict the future status of the gym on a machine by machine basis.  This requires a lot of math and a lot of disk space, so we're still working out the kinks but hope to launch this feature soon.<br /><br />
	<span class = "question">TODAY'S THE DAY</span><br />
	Not only do we have machine specific occupancy data, we can also enable workout specific data.  With a quick login to Cardibo.com using your smartphone, you'll be able to save your workouts online.  We won't store any information that you don't consent to, and we'll never, ever make this data available to anyone else.  Sleep soundly, nobody will know if today wasn't your day in the gym.<br /><br />
	<span class = "question">TOMORROW'S FORECAST: CLOUDY</span><br />
	We're running barebones as we startup, but we've got clouds in our future.  Not the tall, stormy ones, but the digital ones that Apple, Amazon, and many other tech companies are offering to web developers.  What does that mean for you?  Things will run faster and smoother on Cardibo.com, for one.  And with our head in the clouds, the sky's the limit for what new tools we can develop to enhance the Cardibo experience.
