<span class = "question">WHAT IS THIS?</span><br />
<span class = "answer">Cardibo is a website that helps you make informed decisions about when to go to the gym.  We were frustrated with going to the gym only to find out it was packed, so we decided to devise a solution.  We hope it will help you avoid waiting in line for cardio machines, especially during the late afternoon/before dinner rush.</span><br /><br />
<span class = "question">HOW DOES IT WORK?</span><br />
<span class = "answer">Workout equipment like treadmills vibrate with each step you take. We use sensors on each machine to determine whether or not a machine is vibrating. If it is, there's someone on it--simple as that. Vibration data are sent wirelessly to a nearby relay box that uploads the information to the web.</span><br /><br />
<span class = "question">HOW RECENT IS THE INFO I'M SEEING ABOUT THE MACHINES?</span><br />
<span class = "answer">Workout data from machines is updated every 30 seconds, and it takes another 10 seconds to make it to you via the interwebs, so you're about 40 seconds behind what's really going on in the gym.  Let's call it an even minute.</span><br /><br />
<span class = "question">THIS WOULD BE MUCH MORE USEFUL ON MY PHONE.</span><br />
<span class = "answer">We've got you covered.  Head to cardibo.com on your iPhone or Android and start using Cardibo on the go.  Support for Blackberry devices is coming soon.</span><br /><br />
<span class = "question">WHAT'S WITH THE TRIVIA ON THE MOBILE SITE?</span><br />
<span class = "answer">It's just for fun!  You can thank @yuliasashi on Twitter for coming up with the questions every day!</span><br /><br /
<span class = "question">THIS MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE.</span><br />
<span class = "answer">The data our sensors collect is completely anonymous--there's absolutely no way for them to figure out who you are and any depictions of gender in machine images is purely coincidental, sorta like names in Law and Order. If you're still concerned, check out our Privacy Policy.</span><br />
